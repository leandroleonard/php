## 🧭 Purpose

This repository serves as a **living encyclopedia of PHP**, where each `.md` file explains a specific concept — from primitive data types to metaprogramming and engine internals.

> Every article is written as part of a personal learning journey, and shared openly with the PHP community.  
> If you write PHP (or want to learn it), this repo is for you.


## 💡 Philosophy

> “To truly learn PHP is to understand **why** things work, not just **how** they work.”

This project is for:
- Developers who want to **learn PHP in depth**  
- Programmers reviewing or refreshing forgotten topics
