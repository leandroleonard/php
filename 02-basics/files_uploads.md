## Overview

PHP makes it easy to handle file uploads using:
- An HTML `<form>` element with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
- The PHP `$_FILES` superglobal to access uploaded files
- Functions like `move_uploaded_file()` to save them to the server

**Use cases:**
- Profile pictures
- Documents
- Image galleries
- CSV/Excel import tools

## How File Uploads Work

When a user submits a file through an HTML form:
1. The browser sends the file to the server as part of a `POST` request.
2. PHP temporarily stores the file in the system's temp directory.
3. The `$_FILES` array contains details about each uploaded file.
4. You move the file to a permanent location using `move_uploaded_file()`.

## Basic Example

### HTML Form

```html
<form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="file">Select file:</label>
    <input type="file" name="myFile" id="file">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

### PHP Script (`upload.php`)

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $file = $_FILES['myFile'];

    echo "File name: " . $file['name'] . "<br>";
    echo "Temp location: " . $file['tmp_name'] . "<br>";
    echo "Size: " . $file['size'] . " bytes<br>";
}
```

**Example Output:**

```
File name: photo.jpg
Temp location: /tmp/php3h4sd2
Size: 24532 bytes
```

## ðŸª„ Handling Uploads in PHP

You can safely move the uploaded file to a desired directory using:

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $file = $_FILES['myFile'];
    $uploadDir = 'uploads/';
    $targetPath = $uploadDir . basename($file['name']);

    if (move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], $targetPath)) {
        echo "File uploaded successfully!";
    } else {
        echo "Upload failed!";
    }
}
```

> **Note:**
> Always ensure the directory `uploads/` exists and has proper write permissions.

## Validating Uploaded Files

Before saving any uploaded file, **validate it** to avoid errors and security issues.

### Example: File Type and Size Validation

```php
<?php
$allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
$maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB

$file = $_FILES['myFile'];

if (!in_array($file['type'], $allowedTypes)) {
    die("Invalid file type!");
}

if ($file['size'] > $maxSize) {
    die("File too large!");
}

move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], 'uploads/' . basename($file['name']));
echo "Upload successful!";
```

---

## Security Considerations

File uploads can be **a major attack vector** if not handled correctly.
Here are critical precautions:

### Never trust the filename

Attackers can upload files like `shell.php.jpg`.

Use a random name or hash:

```php
$newName = uniqid('upload_', true) . '.jpg';
move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], 'uploads/' . $newName);
```

### Restrict file types

Validate MIME types **and** file extensions.

### Sanitize file names

Remove special characters to avoid path traversal attacks:

```php
$filename = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z0-9_\.-]/", "_", $file['name']);
```

### Store outside public root

Keep uploaded files in directories **not directly accessible** from the web.

## Multiple File Uploads

You can allow multiple files using:

```html
<input type="file" name="files[]" multiple>
```

Then handle them with a loop:

```php
foreach ($_FILES['files']['tmp_name'] as $index => $tmpPath) {
    $name = $_FILES['files']['name'][$index];
    move_uploaded_file($tmpPath, "uploads/" . $name);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue             | Description                                                       |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing `enctype` | The form must include `enctype="multipart/form-data"`             |
| File too large    | Check PHP settings like `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` |
| Wrong permissions | Ensure the upload folder is writable                              |
| Temp file removed | Use `move_uploaded_file()` before the script ends                 |

---

## Summary

File uploads in PHP involve:

1. Creating a form with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.
2. Accessing uploaded files through `$_FILES`.
3. Validating and sanitizing input.
4. Saving the file with `move_uploaded_file()`.
5. Applying strong security rules.

**Remember:**
Security is more important than convenience when handling user-uploaded files.
