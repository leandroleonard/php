# üêò Understanding Late Static Binding (LSB) in PHP

Late Static Binding (LSB) is a PHP feature introduced in **PHP 5.3** that allows **more flexible inheritance** in static contexts.  
It helps resolve references to the **called class** instead of the **class where a method is defined**, enabling dynamic static behavior.

## Overview

Late Static Binding allows a static method or property to refer to the **class that was called at runtime**, not just the one where it was defined.

This is achieved using the `static::` keyword instead of `self::`.

---

## The Problem Before LSB

Before PHP 5.3, `self::` was always **resolved early**, meaning it always referred to the **current class where the method was defined**, even if the method was called by a subclass.

Example (without LSB):

```php
class A {
    public static function who() {
        echo __CLASS__;
    }

    public static function test() {
        self::who(); // Always refers to A
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public static function who() {
        echo __CLASS__;
    }
}

B::test(); // Outputs: A
```

The issue: even though `test()` was called from `B`, it still echoed `A`.

---

## Basic Usage

Using **Late Static Binding**, you can replace `self::` with `static::`, allowing PHP to **resolve the class at runtime**.

```php
class A {
    public static function who() {
        echo __CLASS__;
    }

    public static function test() {
        static::who(); // Late static binding
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public static function who() {
        echo __CLASS__;
    }
}

B::test(); // Outputs: B
```

Now the output reflects the class that **actually invoked** the method.

---

## How It Works

* `self::` ‚Üí Resolved **at compile time** (early binding).
* `static::` ‚Üí Resolved **at runtime** (late static binding).

| Keyword    | Binding Time | Refers To                             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `self::`   | Compile time | The class where the method is defined |
| `static::` | Runtime      | The class that made the call          |

## üîç Example: Without vs With LSB

### Without LSB

```php
class Base {
    public static function who() {
        echo "Base\n";
    }

    public static function call() {
        self::who();
    }
}

class Child extends Base {
    public static function who() {
        echo "Child\n";
    }
}

Child::call(); // Output: Base
```

### With LSB

```php
class Base {
    public static function who() {
        echo "Base\n";
    }

    public static function call() {
        static::who();
    }
}

class Child extends Base {
    public static function who() {
        echo "Child\n";
    }
}

Child::call(); // Output: Child
```

---

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. Works with Static Properties

```php
class Base {
    protected static $type = "Base";

    public static function getType() {
        return static::$type;
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    protected static $type = "Derived";
}

echo Derived::getType(); // Derived
```

### 2. Used in Method Chaining

```php
class Builder {
    public static function create() {
        return new static(); // Late static instantiation
    }
}

class CustomBuilder extends Builder {}

$builder = CustomBuilder::create();
echo get_class($builder); // CustomBuilder
```

### 3. Not Dynamic Objects ‚Äî Still Static Context

Late Static Binding affects **static references**, not instance (`$this`) calls.

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case                   | Description                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fluent interfaces**      | Creating methods that return an instance of the subclass |
| **Static factories**       | Returning subclass instances in inheritance hierarchies  |
| **Active Record models**   | When subclasses represent specific database tables       |
| **Framework base classes** | Allowing core static methods to behave dynamically       |

## Summary

| Concept             | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Introduced in**   | PHP 5.3                                                |
| **Keyword**         | `static::`                                             |
| **Purpose**         | Allow static methods/properties to resolve dynamically |
| **Main Difference** | `static::` (late) vs. `self::` (early)                 |
| **Common Use**      | Inheritance, factories, chaining                       |
